## Team 19 Tomato Farmers John Deere Autonomous Vehicle Hardware Hack 



This repository contains the problem and solution statements, code, and videos of Team 19's John Deere Hardware Hack Autonomous Vehicle for HackIllinois 2024.


## Problem Statement: 
Farmers Aditya, Joe, Leo, and Sophie spend too much time sorting the ripe tomatoes from the unripe tomatoes to sell them at the Champaign Farmers Market. Their plan is to create an autonomous vehicle that can go into their field and do all the tomato sorting for them, so that they can spend more time practicing their line dancing skills for the upcoming barn dance. 

## Solution Statement: 
To solve this problem,  they decided to design an autonomous robot that uses computer vision to identify a tomato, chase after it and understand whether it is ripe or not (red or green). If it detects an unripe tomato, it will move towards it and turn on its green LED. While designing and building the vehicle, the group of farmers ran into some trouble with their pi hat and had to pivot to using a breadboard. With that being said, they were able to hook up their raspberry pi, ultrasonic sensors, and camera successfully to complete the task.
